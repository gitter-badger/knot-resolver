/**
 * @file resolve.h
 * @brief The API provides a high-level API for simple name resolution,
 * and an API providing a "consumer-producer"-like interface to enable
 * you write custom I/O or special iterative resolution driver.
 *
 * # Example usage of the high-level API:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 *
 * struct kr_context ctx = {
 *     .pool = NULL, // for persistent data
 *     .cache = ..., // open cache instance (or NULL)
 *     .layers = {}  // loaded layers
 * };
 *
 * // Push basic layers
 * array_push(ctx.layers, iterate_layer);
 * array_push(ctx.layers, rrcache_layer);
 *
 * // Resolve "IN A cz."
 * knot_pkt_t *answer = knot_pkt_new(NULL, 65535, ctx.pool);
 * int ret = kr_resolve(&ctx, answer, (uint8_t*)"\x02cz", 1, 1);
 * printf("rcode: %d, ancount: %u\n",
 *        knot_wire_get_rcode(answer->wire),
 *        knot_wire_get_ancount(answer->wire));
 * @endcode
 *
 * # Example usage of the iterative API:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 *
 * // Create request and its memory pool
 * struct kr_request req;
 * mm_ctx_mempool(&req.pool, 4096);
 * kr_resolve_begin(&req, ctx, answer);
 * int state = kr_resolve_query(&req, qname, qclass, qtype);
 *
 * // Generate answer
 * while (state == KNOT_STATE_PRODUCE) {
 *
 *     // Additional query generate, do the I/O and pass back answer
 *     state = kr_resolve_produce(&req, &addr, &type, query);
 *     while (state == KNOT_STATE_CONSUME) {
 *         int ret = sendrecv(addr, proto, query, resp);
 *
 *         // If I/O fails, make "resp" empty
 *         state = kr_resolve_consume(&request, resp);
 *         knot_pkt_clear(resp);
 *     }
 *     knot_pkt_clear(query);
 * }
 *
 * // "state" is either DONE or FAIL
 * kr_resolve_finish(&request, state);
