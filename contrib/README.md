# Contributed snippets and libraries

## CCAN

That nice snippets of C code should be moved out of junkcode directories and exposed to a wider world, where they can become something useful.
All embedded snippets should be either in a public domain (CC0) or compatible with BSD.

### Currently used snippets

* [compiler][compiler] - Macros for common compiler extensions. (CC0)
* [ilog][ilog] - Integer logarithm. (CC0)
* [isaac][isaac] - A fast, high-quality pseudo-random number generator. (CC0)

## libknot

Minimal version of libknot that is embedded if it isn't found as a dependency.
